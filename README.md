# Overview

This is an expense tracker. The user will be able to input a name, and an amout for each expence that user has purchased that day. 
The user can decide if they would like to save this to a file of their choice and to view past expenses that are saved. 

I chose to write this program to be able learn the Java language.

# Development Environment

I only used VSCode. I did download some extentions on to vs code that helped me to be able to run it in the console and debug.

I used ArrayList, and libraries that helped me save to a file. I also used the Scanner program to scan what the user is inputing.

# Future Work

- I would like to add a section where the program annalyzes what expenses you have and then gives you advice on how to cut down spending. 
- I would like to add a total function that shows you how much you spent
- I would like to add a monthly expenses class.
